👨‍🎓 I'm a first-year graduate student at Xiamen University. 

🖊 I'm currently working on projects regarding my Master's Thesis in the field of large language models and time series data, including applications and explanations. 

💡 I'm also open to various topics about Machine Learning including but not limited to foundation models, multi-modal learning and XAI, related cooperation worldwide would be appreciated!
